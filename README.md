# Sales Performance Analysis for ABC Company
## Overview

The sales dashboard provides a comprehensive view of ABC Company's sales performance across multiple dimensions, including geography, salespersons, products, time periods, and customer preferences. The data used for this analysis was derived from different sources and techniques:
•	Sales data by weekday, geography, and product categories was extracted from an Oracle database using the GROUP BY function, summarizing total sales trends.

•	Filtered sales insights for specific conditions were obtained using the HAVING clause in SQL, allowing a deeper analysis of total sales by product, salespersons, and time period.

•	A detailed sales breakdown across multiple dimensions was achieved by joining multiple tables from the Oracle database, enabling cross-referencing of sales by region, category, and salesperson.

•	Advanced calculations for high and low sales performance were performed using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions in Power BI, providing insights into trends over time and sales segmentation by region and product category.

•	Various visualization techniques such as bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, and line charts were utilized to present sales trends effectively.

These insights will help ABC Company optimize its sales strategy, improve resource allocation, and enhance decision-making processes.
